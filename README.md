## Hi there! Welcome!

I am Roy Hsu, a Brown University trained computational biologist and data scientist with a background in molecular biology and machine learning. I enjoy tackling complex problems with data-driven solutions. 

Take a look at my projects! they range from weather prediction using Markov Chains to SAT data analysis and fun Python games!  

Explore my repositories to see how I apply AI, statistical modeling, and bioinformatics to solve real-world challenges!  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a SQL project ðŸ˜Š
- ðŸŒ± I recently built a Markov Chain process to predict weather based on the previous day's status.
- ðŸ’¬ I'd love to chat about molecular biology ðŸ”¬ and how that translates to data science
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-hsu-brown/) or [GitHub](https://www.github.com/hsur05)  
- ðŸ˜Ž Fun fact: I love EDM! Skrillex is GOAT
