## Hi there! Welcome! 👋👋👋

I am Roy Hsu, a Brown University trained computational biologist and data scientist with a background in molecular biology and machine learning.

I enjoy tackling complex problems with data-driven solutions. 

My projects range from weather prediction using Markov Chains to SAT data analysis and fun Python games.
